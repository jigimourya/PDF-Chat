# PDF-Chat

## Overview

PDF-Chat is an AI-powered application that enables users to interact with and query large PDF documents using advanced Natural Language Processing techniques. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) with the Langchain framework, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), this project simplifies information extraction from PDFs.

## Features

• Conversational PDF Interaction: Ask questions and get relevant answers from PDF documents.

• Streamlit UI: User-friendly web interface for smooth interactions.

• Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhances responses by retrieving the most relevant text snippets from PDFs.

• FAISS Vector Store: Efficient similarity search for faster and more accurate information retrieval.

• Scalability: Handles large PDF documents effectively.

## Technologies Used

• Langchain: Framework for building LLM applications.

• FAISS: Vector database for fast similarity search.

• Streamlit: Interactive UI framework.

• OpenAI API (or other LLMs): For natural language understanding.

• Python: Core language for development.


## Usage

• Upload a PDF document through the Streamlit UI.

• Enter queries in natural language related to the PDF content.

• Receive relevant responses based on retrieved information using FAISS and RAG.

• Interact with document for comprehensive analysis.

## Future Enhancements

• Support for multiple PDFs at once.

• Enhanced response summarization.

• Integration with other LLM providers.
